# Adapt-Ableplayer
Current solution is to add an iFrame inside a text component

<iframe width="100%" height="1250px " class=”frame-area” src="externals/Valerie_T1_EN/index.html"></iframe>

We should look at building that into an official component.
We can re-use the text component but have the iFrame code added in the back-end so it can never get deleted.
We can also make options of the Able Player visible in the Adapt Authoring tool
